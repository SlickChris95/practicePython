'''
Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25])
and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list.
For practice, write this code inside a function.

'''

list = [2,34,3,5321,3442,9092,8548]
list2 = [list[0],list[len(list) -1]]

print(list)
print(list2)
