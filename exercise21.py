'''
Take the code from the How To Decode A Website
exercise (if you didnâ€™t do it or just want to play
with some different code, use the code from the
solution), and instead of printing the results to
a screen, write the results to a txt file. In your
code, just make up a name for the file you are
saving to.

Extras:

Ask the user to specify the name of the output
file that will be saved:

'''
path = 'C:\\Users\\Chris\\Desktop\\'
fileName = "this_is_a_test.txt"
path = path + fileName
with open(path,'w') as open_file:
    open_file.write('Hello World')
